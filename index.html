	It isn't everyday that you have a plumbing issue, but when you there is one, it can be one of the most inconvenient problems in your home.  We are dedicated to making sure that our Longview residents don't have to suffer through long waits, poor quality, or the fear of an impending issue.  With preventative measure services, emergency service offerings, and a reputation for the go-to plumbing company in Longview, we are confident that we will meet your needs.  Water heater installation and repairs are our specialty, but we can meet all of your plumbing needs.

	We take pride in the wide range of services we provide, all at rates that no other plumber can match. We clean drains, unclog toilets; unclog bathtubs, sinks, and showers. Gas lines may also be installed, as well as detecting gas leaks, which must be fixed as soon as possible because they are unsafe and potentially life-threatening. We are the best to call if you want a new kitchen or new appliances that need to be fitted, such as a dishwasher or plumbing, because your layouts have changed. You want a new bathroom with a new bathtub, and we can help you with that as well! One of life's pleasures is having hot water, and you'll need a water heater to provide it. We install and repair tankless and conventional water heaters. A backflow preventer is required by law in Longview and Kilgore, Texas, and we will gladly install, maintain, and do the required annual testing of the preventer.  We specialize and focus on the install and repair of water heaters, but if you have any plumbing problems, we can solve them!
